Hello,
My name is Michael Kanios.

Before transitioning fully into web development, I worked
in Sales as a Sales Manager for 20 years in pharmaceutical industry, which has given me strong
communication skills and a business-oriented mindset —
something I always bring into my web projects.

Over the past months, I’ve been developing projects using
React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS, focusing on creating
clean, responsive, and performance-oriented front-end
builds.

This modern stack has helped me adopt a component-based,
reusable, and scalable approach to web development.
In parallel, I have solid experience as a WordPress
developer, building and optimizing websites with
Elementor Pro, custom CSS, and thoughtful plugin
selection based on performance, security, and
maintainability.

I have experience with:
• React / Next.js front-end development using
TailwindCSS
• Creating modular UI components and clean layout
structures
• Responsive design and optimized page performance
• Building and editing WordPress websites with
Elementor Pro
• Custom CSS and small JavaScript tweaks when needed

I’m looking for a collaborative and growth-focused
environment where I can contribute long-term, improve my
technical skills, and deliver reliable, well-structured
solutions.
