Hello,
My name is Michael Kanios.

I currently work in the pharmaceutical industry, where I have over 20 years of experience as a Sales Manager. 
This has helped me develop strong communication skills and a business mindset, 
which I also bring into my web projects.

At the same time, I am transitioning into web development. Over the past months, 
i have been building front-end projects using React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS, focusing on clean, responsive, 
and fast user interfaces.

I also have solid experience with WordPress, working with Elementor Pro, 
custom CSS, and careful plugin selection to ensure good performance and maintainability.

I enjoy working in a collaborative environment where I can grow as a developer, 
improve my skills, and deliver reliable, well-structured solutions.
